      <p>Quantum computation is … nothing less than a distinctly new way of harnessing nature … It will be the first technology that allows useful tasks to be performed in collaboration between parallel universes, and then sharing the results.</p>

				<p>Quantum computing is the area of study focused on developing computer technology based on the principles of quantum theory, which explains the nature and behavior of energy and matter on the quantum (atomic and subatomic) level. Development of a quantum computer, if practical, would mark a leap forward in computing capability far greater than that from the abacus to a modern day supercomputer, with performance gains in the billion-fold realm and beyond. The quantum computer, following the laws of quantum physics, would gain enormous processing power through the ability to be in multiple states, and to perform tasks using all possible permutations simultaneously.</p>

		<p> Sampling from high-dimensional probability distributions is at the core of a wide spectrum of computational techniques with
		important applications across science, engineering, and society. Examples include deep learning, probabilistic programming, and 
		other machine learning and artificial intelligence applications.</p>
		<p>Data miners would be able to use those highly capable quantum computers in order to mine the data by significantly decreasing the time needed to mine that data
		to execute more work at a limited time.</p>
		<p> Not now but one day, if we would be able to integrate the quantum computed machine learning system into the autonomous vehicles, this would prevent the malfunctions and decrease the
		time needed to process/analyze the road in order to stop in case of an emergency.

<p> Quantum chemistry is the science of understanding the complicated bonds and reactions of molecules using quantum mechanics.
		The 'moving parts' of anything but the most-simple chemical processes are beyond the capacity of the biggest and fastest supercomputers.</p>
		<p> By modelling and understanding these processes using quantum computers, scientists expect to unlock lower-energy pathways for chemical reactions, allowing the design of new catalysts.
		This will have huge implications for industries, such as the production of fertilisers.</p>
		<p> Other possible applications include the development of organic solar cells and better batteries
		through improved materials and using new insights to design personalised medicines. </p>
