				<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YX40hbAHx3s"> Computational complexity <a>theory tells us a lot about how difficult problems are, and how much more difficult they get when their inputs increase. A variety of problems in Computer Science fall under the complexity class of those that can be solved in "Nondeterministic Polynomial" Time, or NP - this means that a classical deterministic Turing Machine-style computer has no efficient way of solving them. Such problems include:</p>
				<ul>
					<li>Boolean Satisfiability</li>
					<li>Prime Factorisation</li>
					<li>Travelling Salesman Problem</li>
					<li>Optimal Rubik's Cube Solving</li>
				</ul>
				Problems like Boolean Satisfiability are what are known as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_NP-complete_problems"> NP-Complete </a>- this class of problems can all be reduced or transformed to each other, so finding an efficient algorithm to crack one automatically brings you most of the way to cracking the rest.
				</p>
				<!-- You never opened a p to match eith the close p here -->
				<h3 style="font-size:32px"><b>So what?</b></h3>
				<p>
				Determining whether there exists a Polynomial (P) time algorithm for NP-Complete problems would be a monumental scientific breakthrough. Closing the problem such that P does not equal NP would forever categorise some problems as not efficiently solvable, putting a mathematical upper bound on knowledge and computation that humanity would not be able to breach. However, breaking down the border between P and NP would not be completely positive. Things like protein folding, a problem in biology linked to finding cures for terminal illnesses, and other ridiculously hard problems would, overnight, become tractable (if not exactly easy). This would also have implications for fields that rely on intractable problems, like cryptography - encryption techniques like RSA that rely on large primes that cannot be easily factorised would lose their potency, as any old hacker with a powerful enough computer would be able to bypass this layer of security.
