				<p>Computational complexity theory tells us a lot about how difficult problems are, and how much more difficult they get when their inputs increase.</p>

					<li>Object detection</li>
					<li>Image classification</li>
					<li>Voice recognition</li>
					<li>Machine translation</li>
				</ul>
				These advances open up a world of opportunities for innovation, ranging from self-driving cars to improved medical diagnoses. The aim of this article will be to explore some of these innovations and how they could affect society in a positive way.

				<h3 style="font-size:32px"><b>Machine Translation</b></h3>
				<p>
				Most people are familiar with the concept of machine translation, however what might not be as well-known is that modern translation apps such as <a href="https://translate.google.co.uk/">Google Translate</a> and <a href="https://www.bing.com/translator">Bing Translator</a> actually incorporate machine learning at their core. High quality machine translation has the potential to unite parts of society that were previously divided by language barriers.
				</p>
				
				<h3 style="font-size:32px"><b>Self-Driving Cars</b></h3>
				<p>The concept of self-driving cars has existed for decades. Despite this, self-driving cars have only become possible due to relatively recent advancements in computer vision, aided by machine learning. These cars have the potential to provided an efficient mode of transport which is safer than human-driven cars. </p>
