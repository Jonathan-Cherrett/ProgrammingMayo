# Interest of content - Excellent
* Interesting content over a range of topics, some could have a bit more detail
#Consistency and quality of visual presentation - Good
* Pretty good, but the quantum computing page uses a different format for headings
* For some reason I couldn't find, the distance between the picture of mayo and the word mayo is smaller on the machine learning page than all the other pages
# Quality of written presentation - Excellent
I couldn't find any spelling mistakes and the paragraphs were all good.
#Validity of HTML - Sound
* All pages failed the HTML validator, they had no impact on the displayed page, but they should have been fixed nonetheless.
* This didn't show in the HTML validator, but almost none of your pages had the javascript imported for the navbar to work on mobile
#Evidence of collaboration - Excellent
* All authors had roughly the same amount of committed lines
* The author info seemed to all be written by other people
* There was quite a lot of commits in the last 24 hours, but there were also a decent spread over the rest of the time, so not too bad
