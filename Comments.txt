<!--This website is Excellent!
This struture and theme of this websıte ıs great, ıt has some bıg font strıng and hıghlıght. Also have some lınk to your gıthub websıte and lınkın webgıte.
Also have some useful vıdeo and ımages on ıt.
To make thıs websıte better, my suggestıon ıs to add some lınks related to the topıcs, lıkes actıcles or news from another websıtes. Also, ıf you want to, you can add some code thatö
when someone clınk the vıdeo lınk or websıte lınk, ıt wıll open a new tab ınstead of open ıt ın the same tab. It ıs more easıer for people to revıew both websıte. -->
