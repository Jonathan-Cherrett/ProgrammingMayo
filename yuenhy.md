Review of Programming Mayo

#Interest of content
Exemplary   
- Machine Learning, Computer Graphics, Computational Complexity, Quantum Computation are all undoubtedly interesting

#Consistency and quality of visual presentation
Excellent consistency
- Colors/ layout are similar throughout the pages.
However visual presentation, whilst excellent, can be better. 
- Good use of h1 h2 etc
- Hyperlinks instead of direct links.
Consider the following:
- Set a fix width so that your paragraphs wrap around neatly and not from edge to edge
- Add left/ right padding so that eyes do not need to strain left to right but rather in a streamlined flow.
- Look into responsive images so that your photos are not obscenely huge (like the one in n v np).

#Quality of written presentation
Outstanding. Not overly complicated.

#Validity of HTML
Excellent
- Everything is closed neatly
- Although, might want to put consolidate styling into one css page (avoid inline styling)
